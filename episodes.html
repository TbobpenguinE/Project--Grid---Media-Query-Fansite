        <h3>Episode 1: Swing Into Action</h3>
        <p>
          Yuya is thrown into a high-pressure Duel in front of a live audience. His attempt
          to smile through the pressure sets the tone for his whole “entertainment duel”
          philosophy.

        <h3>Episode 2: You Show, You Duel</h3>
        <p>
          We see more of You Show Duel School, its weird teaching style, and why Yuya’s
          friends believe in him even when the school looks like a joke to everyone else.

        <h3>Episode 3: The Pendulum Miracle</h3>
        <p>
          Pendulum Summoning takes the stage and completely changes how duels look.

        <h3>Key Arc Episode: Synchro Showdown</h3>
        <p>
          In the Synchro Dimension, duels are tied to status and control. Yuya clashes
          with a system where losing a duel means more than just losing LP.
        </p>

          <li>Focus characters: Yuya &amp; local rivals</li>

        <h3>Key Arc Episode: Dragons and Doubt</h3>
        <p>
          Yuya’s dragons mirror his emotional state, and the show leans into how scary
          it feels when your power starts to slip out of your control.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Focus character: Yuya Sakaki</li>
