        <h2>Step into the World of Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V</strong> follows Yuya Sakaki, an Entertainment Duelist
          who wants to make people smile with his duels. Along the way, he learns about
          Pendulum Summoning, interdimensional conflict, and the truth behind the four
          separate dimensions linked by Duel Monsters.

      <h3>What Is ARC-V About?</h3>
      <p>
        The story begins in the Standard Dimension, where Yuya studies at You Show Duel
        School and dreams of becoming a great entertainer like his father. His life changes
        when a high-stakes Duel gives him the chance to show off a new summoning method:
        <strong>Pendulum Summoning</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the series goes on, the cast is pulled into a conflict that spans the
        <strong>Standard, Synchro, Xyz, and Fusion</strong> dimensions. Friends and rivals
        from each world collide, and duels become a way to fight for freedom, identity,
        and what “smiles” actually mean.

        ARC-V mixes classic Yu-Gi-Oh! duel hype with new mechanics and the idea that
        dueling is a performance meant to bring joy, even when the stakes get absurdly high.

      <h3>Why Watch ARC-V?</h3>
      <p>
        ARC-V is packed with creative duel setups, overdramatic speeches, and big emotional
        swings involving dragons, friends, and morally questionable adults. If you like
        card games that behave like full-on boss battles, this series is very much that.
