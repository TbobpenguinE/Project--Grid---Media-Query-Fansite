        <h2>Characters and Scenes</h2>
        <p>
          Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V has bold colors, loud duel fields, and character designs
          that lean into “maximum dramatic hair”. This page shows a few important
          faces and places.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can replace these placeholder images with real screenshots later,
          like Yuya, Yuzu, Reiji, the school, and your favorite duel moments.

          <h3>Major Antagonist</h3>
          <p>
            ARC-V has several “villain” figures, from CEOs to invaders from

          <p>
            A small, “weak-looking” duel school that actually encourages fun and

          <h3>Emotional Moment</h3>
          <p>
            The show likes to drop big emotional scenes in the middle of duels.
            Tears, shouting, and card effects all at once.

        <h2>Visual Details to Watch</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How each dimension uses color to show its mood.</li>

          <li>Posters and signs in the background of city scenes.</li>
          <li>Differences between “fun” duels and war-like duels.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="gal-highlight">
          <p>
            Even if you ignore the card text, you can follow a lot of the story
            just by watching colors, expressions, and posing.
