        <h2>Characters and Scenes</h2>
        <p>
          Yu-Gi-Oh! ARC-V has bold colors, loud duel fields, and character designs
          that lean into “maximum dramatic hair”. This page shows a few important
          faces and places.

          <h3>Yuya Sakaki</h3>
          <p>
            The main character. An Entertainment Duelist who wants to make people
            smile, even when things get serious, stubborn one.
          </p>

        <div class="gal-item">
          <img src="https://ms.yugipedia.com//1/13/Zuzu_Boyle.png" alt="Zuzu/Yuzu portrait style">
          <h3>Zuzu / Yuzu</h3>
          <p>
            Yuya’s friend who backs him up in duels and arguments. Known for her
            strong sense of justice (and her paper fan).

          <h3>Major Antagonist</h3>
          <p>
            ARC-V has several “villain” figures, from CEOs to invaders from
            other dimensions. Many of them have their own reasons. This one's the CEO type.

          <img src="https://ms.yugipedia.com//7/7d/You_Show_Duel_School.png" alt="You Show Duel School">
          <h3>You Show Duel School</h3>
          <p>
            A small, “weak-looking” duel school that actually encourages fun and
            creativity, being more of a hub for outcasts in contrast to LID. It feels like home for the main cast.

          <img src="https://ms.yugipedia.com//b/bf/ArcV_034.png" alt="Emotional ARC-V scene">
          <h3>Emotional Moment</h3>
          <p>
            The show likes to drop big emotional scenes in the middle of duels.
            Tears, shouting, and card effects all at once... they are playing a card game for your information.
          </p>

        <div class="gal-item">
          <img src="https://ms.yugipedia.com//7/7b/ArcV_056.png" alt="Action Duel scene">
          <h3>Action Duel</h3>
          <p>
            Action Duels mix running, jumping, and grabbing Action Cards from
            the field with normal card game strategy.

      <div class="gal-notes">
        <h2>Visual Details to Watch</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How each dimension uses color to show its mood.</li>
          <li>How Yuya’s roster of dragons change as the story goes on.</li>
          <li>Posters and signs in the background of city scenes.</li>
          <li>Differences between “fun” duels and war-like duels, because it's war.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="gal-highlight">
          <p>
            Even if you ignore the card text, you can follow a lot of the story
            just by watching colors, expressions, and posing, not surprising.
